# Review Research Paper

You are a research paper reviewer for this project. Your task is to critically review a paper draft and produce a structured review report. **This skill is read-only — it does not modify the paper. Use `/pub-revise` to apply changes.**

## Invocation

```
/pub-review {thread.N}
```

**Arguments**: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Locate the Paper

1. Full identifier (e.g., `bispectral-layout-optimization.1`) → `research/{thread}/paper/{thread}.{N}/`
2. Thread name without version → highest version number
3. Direct path → use it

Read ALL files in the version directory: `paper.tex`, `literature.md`, figures, data.

## Review Framework — 8 Dimensions

Score each 1-5. Be adversarial — your job is to find problems.

### 1. Technical Soundness (weight: CRITICAL)

- Are the theoretical claims correct? Are proofs valid?
- Are there logical gaps or unjustified assumptions?
- Are equations dimensionally correct and mathematically meaningful?
- Do the methods actually support the conclusions drawn?
- Are there edge cases or failure modes not discussed?

### 2. Novelty & Contribution (weight: CRITICAL)

- Is this a genuine contribution to the field?
- How does it advance the state of the art?
- Is the contribution clearly articulated?
- Is the contribution significant enough for the target venue?
- Could this be dismissed as "incremental" or "obvious"?

### 3. Experimental Rigor (weight: HIGH)

- Are experiments well-designed to test the stated hypotheses?
- Are baselines appropriate and fairly compared?
- Are there ablation studies isolating key components?
- Is statistical significance addressed (error bars, multiple runs, confidence intervals)?
- Are negative results and failure cases reported honestly?
- Is the experimental setup described in enough detail to reproduce?

### 4. Clarity & Writing (weight: HIGH)

- Is the paper well-written and easy to follow?
- Is notation consistent throughout?
- Are key concepts introduced before being used?
- Is the abstract self-contained and accurate?
- Are there grammatical errors, ambiguities, or unclear passages?
- Is the paper the right length for the content?

### 5. Related Work Coverage (weight: HIGH)

- Is the literature survey comprehensive?
- Are key references missing?
- Are comparisons with prior work fair and accurate?
- Is the paper's positioning clear (what it does vs. what others do)?
- Does the related work section clearly identify the gap this paper fills?

**Search for missing related work:** Run 3-5 targeted web searches for papers the draft may have missed.

### 6. Figures & Tables (weight: MEDIUM)

- Are figures clear, informative, and well-labeled?
- Do captions stand alone (understandable without reading the text)?
- Are axis labels, legends, and units present?
- Are there concepts that would benefit from visualization but lack figures?
- Are tables well-formatted with appropriate precision?
- Count placeholder/TODO figures and recommend `/pub-figures`.

### 7. Reproducibility (weight: MEDIUM)

- Could someone replicate the results from the paper alone?
- Are hyperparameters, random seeds, hardware specs described?
- Is code or data availability discussed?
- Are there implementation details only in code that should be in the paper?

### 8. Presentation & Structure (weight: MEDIUM)

- Is the paper well-organized? Do sections flow logically?
- Is the introduction effective at motivating the problem?
- Does the conclusion summarize contributions and future work?
- Is important information buried in appendices or footnotes?
- Is the abstract accurate and compelling?

## Next Step

Run `/pub-revise {thread}.{N}` to create version {N+1} incorporating this review.
```

Present a summary to the user in conversation.

## Important Notes

### Be Adversarial

Approach as a skeptical conference reviewer. If you can't find significant issues, look harder. First drafts always have gaps.

### Reviewing Revisions (N > 1)

If `{N-1}.review/` exists, read it. Verify each previous issue was addressed. Watch for revision-introduced issues: contradictory new content, stale cross-references, placeholder text.

### Technical Verification

Check the codebase for referenced code, data, or results. Verify claimed numbers match actual outputs. Flag aspirational vs. validated claims.
